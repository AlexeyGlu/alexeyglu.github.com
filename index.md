## 📝 About Me
![Image Description](https://alexeyglu.github.io/photo.jpeg)

I have been involved in cybersecurity for 7 years with 5 years of industry experience as a Security Operations Specialist in MSSP SOC. SIEM - is my best friend <3. Usually, I am involved in security monitoring and defense.

I am proficient in Linux and Windows environments (Active Directory guys here). My expertise extends to network and host forensics, intrusion detection, and anomaly monitoring. 

Beyond my hands-on experience, I've shared my knowledge through cybersecurity training specifically for Ukraine's Critical Infrastructure sectors. 

To enhance my skills, I consistently participate in CTF competitions. 🏆
